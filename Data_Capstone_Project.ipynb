    "For this project we will need to explore, segment and cluster the 5 Boroughs and 306 Neighborhoods of New York City. There is a free dataset on the web that contains the geospatial location of each borough and neighborhoods, i.e. latitude and longitude coordinates of their centroids. The link to this dataset is: https://geo.nyu.edu/catalog/nyu_2451_34572\n",
    "The format of the dataset is like the folowing example:\n",
    "\n",
    " \tBorough Neighborhood Latitude \t Longitude\n",
    "0 \tBronx \tWakefield \t40.894705 \t-73.847201\n",
    "1 \tBronx \tCo-op City \t40.874294 \t-73.829939\n",
    "2 \tBronx \tEastchester 40.887556 \t-73.827806\n",
    "3 \tBronx \tFieldston \t40.895437 \t-73.905643\n",

    "We'll use these coordinates to extract venue information from the Foursquare API, using a free-personal account. We'll find out what are the most common venues in a selected, filtered list of neighborhoods and cluster them according to their similarities (we'll call them TOP neighborhoods).\n",

    "The dataframe for the most common venues of a neighborhood is going to look like this:\n",

    "Astoria \t        1 \t        Middle Eastern Restaurant \tBar \t                Hookah Bar \t\n",
